## What is Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)?

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a crucial step in the data analysis process. It involves the initial exploration, visualization, and summary of the data to gain insights, identify patterns, and detect potential issues. EDA helps data analysts and scientists understand the data's distribution, relationships between variables, and any peculiarities that may influence subsequent analysis and modeling.

In EDA, various statistical and graphical techniques are employed to uncover meaningful information from the data, which can then guide further analyses, data cleaning, and modeling decisions.
